## What is OfferNets

OfferNets is a research initiative[^1] that aims at creating a radically decentralized economy which is powered by diverse network of independently operating and interacting agents. It combines two R&D paths which are tightly related yet embrace different levels of abstraction:

(a) *Decentralized computing*: a massively scalable computing model and a software framework supporting asynchronous execution of heterogeneous processes concurrently using a shared data structure and allowing to model any mixture of emergent and controlled coordination among them.
(b) *OfferNets economy*: a decentralized economy providing alternative to purely currency based exchanges; it features a complex network of interactions and optimizes reciprocal exchanges of goods and services by finding agents with compatible and complementary preferences and coordinating their interactions.

Research and development of (b) OfferNets economy is crucially dependent on (a) Decentralized computing path but the importance and application of the latter is much broader than the former. This means that we are designing the decentralized computing and simulation modelling platform to be maximally horizontally scalable beyond applications for OfferNets economy.

## Scope & directions

### Decentralized computing

The concept of open-ended decentralized computing[^1] is an idea being developed within OfferNets research initiative which allows heterogeneous asynchronous processes to achieve spontaneous or guided compatibility via indirect communication through a shared topological space. The rationale of pursuing implementation and computational testing of this model is to conceive a computational framework able to perform large scale simulations of decentralized economy employing different combinations of governance regimes and structures, multiple currencies, barter networks and more. Furthermore, despite the model is inherently decentralized, it allows to implement (or allow to emerge) different levels of centralization as deem needed. The architecture of the computational framework is documented in more detail [here](https://singnet.github.io/offernet/public/offernet-documentation/conceptual-framework.html#conceptual-architecture).

### Simulation engine

The software architecture on which OfferNets simulations are run consists of two large parts: (1) actor framework for powering asynchronous execution of heterogeneous agents' logic and (2) graph database powered by enterprise level graph database server for keeping and updating the topology information on the network. For reading and mutating topology information software agents we use Apache TinkerPop graph computing engine.
