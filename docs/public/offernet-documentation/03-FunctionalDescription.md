# Functional Description

Functional description of the software is automatically generated from behavioural test suite (latest build report available is [here](../cucumber-html-reports/overview-features.html)). Every behaviour described below is already implemented and working. Note, therefore, that the aim of this section is to describe already **implemented** functionality, contrary to planned functionality, described elsewhere -- e.g. [Conceptual Framework]. Therefore #2, the contents of this section gets augmented every time the new behaviour is implemented and tested -- so evolves in parallel with the [codebase](https://github.com/singnet/offernet).
